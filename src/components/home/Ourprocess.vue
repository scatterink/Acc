      Our Process

    <div class="mb-4">
      Our process follows business best practice procedures. Here is how we get to know you, your existing methods and your personal future goals.
      First, we schedule a Discovery Call wherein we make sure we are a good fit for each other.  During this discovery call we find out all about you and/or your business and how we can help.

    <div class="mb-4">
      Once we have established a plan, we lay out the terms of our agreement in an Engagement Letter. With our responsibilities clearly outlined, we then arrange for an Onboarding Session where we gather all of the information required to set you up on the path to an organized business and ensure compliance with your government obligations.
