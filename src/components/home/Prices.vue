    <div class="mb-4">
      It depends.

    <div class="mb-4">
      It's probably not the answer you'd like to hear because at the very least, you'd like to see a range.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      As we work with many organizations of different sizes,
      prices vary depending on complexity, urgency, size and the services you'll need.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      Rather than set pricing expectations that may not match your unique situation,
      we'd love you to reach out and go through our discovery process. At this point, we'll be able to provide specific prices and options to work within your own situation.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <b><i>Free assessment.</i></b> Our initial assessment are free, as we use this opportunity to
      discuss your individual and/or business goals and challenges to determine how we can best help you.

    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3><i>Why are there no prices on this page?</i></h3>
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      Other accounting services companies give you a rate per hour, which isn’t
      useful if you don’t know how many hours your engagment takes. Our free needs
      assessment helps ensure you know exactly what your payments are per month for
      our services, base on your specific needs..
    </div>

    <div class="mb-4">
      Also, We put a lot of effort into a customized financial plan that spans everything
      from tax, technology, and internal procedures. Because each corporation is in
      a different position, our price ranges are quite large and we'd rather earn your
      trust during the sales process so you can truly compare us to others.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      There's nothing worse than overcharging someone because it's your 'standard package'
      or undercharging and constantly experiencing frustration due to 'scope creep'.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      <h3><i>What can I expect if I hire you?</i></h3>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4" />
    <div class="mb-4">
      We tend to be the last accounting firm a company works with before bringing everything in-house.
      While other online firms are typically cheaper, few have the depth, abilities or experience to
      keep your stress levels low and get it right the first time.
    </div>
    <div class="mb-4">
      To that end, we serve you the way we'd want to be served and never settle for mediocrity.
